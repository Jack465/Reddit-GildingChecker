# Reddit-GildingChecker
This started as a r/RequestABot request, however, I abandoned the project before finishing. The code is mostly finished, it checks to see how many awards a reddit post has, and then displays the count to the console. You can modify the action to assign a flair or something to the user.

## Requirements
```
pip3 install praw
```
